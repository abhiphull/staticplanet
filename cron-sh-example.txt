How to set it up:

1. Get and configure some web space to upload static HTML pages.
   There are many options.

2. Get a machine that can run periodic cron jobs reliably.
   Doesn't need to be publicly visible.
   Choose the level of sandboxing according to your taste and set it up.

3. Set up a cron job running regularly on the machine.
   It needs to run `make` and publish files under `html/` to your
   static html storage. See below for example

As of Sep 2018, Planet Scipy runs on https://netlify.com (thanks!)

Steps taken: 

1. create account and download netlifyctl
2. create access token and save to file ``token`` on server
3. `netlifyctl site create -n your-own-name-for-site -A $(cat token)`
4. look up the site ID on the web interface and save to file ``site-id``
   the netlifyctl command needs it for uploading stuff

Example shell script for periodic updates with cron follows:

#!/bin/sh
set -e
cd /home/planetscipy/var

run() {
    git -C staticplanet fetch origin
    git -C staticplanet reset --hard origin/master
    git -C staticplanet submodule update --init
    make -C staticplanet
    ./netlifyctl deploy -A `cat token` -n planetscipy -s `cat site-id` -P staticplanet/html/
}

run < /dev/null > cron.log 2>&1
